# Proxy Server

This is a simple Node.js server that fetches an image from a given URL and converts it to a Base64 string. It uses `Express` for the server, `Axios` for HTTP requests, and `CORS` to allow cross-origin requests.

## Features

- Fetch an image from a URL.
- Convert the image to a Base64 string.
- Return the Base64 string as a JSON response.
